create an object representing the board.
var board = new Board 

create a property of the board that tracks the state of the board.
[["","",""],["","",""],["","",""]];

create an object that represents on occupied space on the board and the player.
var occupied = new Occupied(column, row, currentuser);

create a method on board that allows user to add a new occupied.

game.switchUser();

determine if a space is already occupied
board.isOccupied(column, row)

determine if there is a win
  check if each inner array is the same.
  check if each beginning of array is the same then middle then last
  check if first value of first array and second value of second array and last of third array is the same
  check if last value of first array and second value of second array and first value of third array is the same
  
  change game object state to game.won(currentuser)

Easy game.
  computer plays after game player switches.
  flattens the board.boardState and then map the empty spaces with index values
  filter to only the mapped index spaces
  randomly choose an indexed space;

Hard game.
computer plays top left corner
computer plays bottom right corner if not occupied else play bottom left corner
if player plays bottom right corner then play bottom left corner. otherwise 
  either place a space to block the player from getting a tic tac toe or play the bottom right corner.
  if there is an available space to complete a tic tac toe go for that.
computer plays top right corner unless it needs to block player.
